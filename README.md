ReactJS ES6 Browserify Sass Boilerplate
=======================================

An easy way to start new ReactJS projects.

Just run ```npm install``` and then ```grunt``` to start watching for changes on .js, .jsx and .es6 JS files and .scss CSS files, and concurrently run a server on port 9000.

Enjoy!
