ReactJS ES6 Browserify Sass Boilerplate
=======================================

An easy way to start new ReactJS projects. Apologies for the project's name, suggestions accepted! :D

This boilerplate contains all I find essential starting a project:

* JS minification when I save a JS file (ES6 and JSX welcome)
* CSS minification when I save a SCSS file
* Serving the project locally, with all requests routed to the root URL (go crazy with [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router))
* single grunt task to do all of the above

Just run ```npm install``` to fetch all packages, and then ```grunt``` to get started.

Hope you find this useful. Feedback welcome, too!
